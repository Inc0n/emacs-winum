;; Options to configure Winum from Customize or user config.


;;; Code:


(defgroup winum nil
  "Navigate and manage windows using numbers."
  :group 'convenience)


(defcustom winum-scope 'global
  "Frames affected by a number set."
  :group 'winum
  :type  '(choice
           (const :tag "frame local" frame-local)
           (const :tag "visible frames" visible)
           (const :tag "global" global)))


(defcustom winum-reverse-frame-list nil
  "If t, order frames by reverse order of creation.
Has effect only when `winum-scope' is not 'frame-local."
  :group 'winum
  :type  'boolean)


(defcustom winum-auto-assign-0-to-minibuffer t
  "If non-nil, `winum-mode' assigns 0 to the minibuffer when active."
  :group 'winum
  :type  'boolean)


(defcustom winum-assign-func nil
  "Function called for each window by `winum-mode'.
This is called before automatic assignment begins.  The function should
return a number to have it assigned to the current-window, nil otherwise.

This function along with `winum-auto-assign-0-to-minibuffer' are the only
ways to have 0 assigned to a window.

Example: always assign *Calculator* the number 9 and *NeoTree* the number 0:

  (defun my-winum-assign-func ()
    (cond
     ((equal (buffer-name) \"*Calculator*\")
      9)
     ((string-match-p (buffer-name) \".*\\*NeoTree\\*.*\")
      0)
     (t
      nil)))

  (setq winum-assign-func 'my-winum-assign-func)"
  :group 'winum
  :type  'function)


(make-obsolete-variable 'winum-assign-func 'winum-assign-functions "2.0.0")


(defcustom winum-assign-functions nil
  "List of functions called for each window by `winum-mode'.

These functions allow for deterministic assignment of numbers to windows. Each
function is called for every window. A function should return the number to be
assigned to a window or nil. The *first* function to output a number for
a given window will determine this window's number.

If the list is empty or if every functions returns nil for a given window winum
will proceed to automatic number assignment.

Since this list is meant to allow custom window assignment for *mutiple*
packages at once it should never be directly set, only added to and removed
from.

These functions, along with `winum-auto-assign-0-to-minibuffer', are the only
way to have 0 assigned to a window.

Example: always assign *Calculator* the number 9, *Flycheck-errors* the number 8
and *NeoTree* the number 0:

  (defun winum-assign-9-to-calculator-8-to-flycheck-errors ()
    (cond
     ((equal (buffer-name) \"*Calculator*\") 9)
     ((equal (buffer-name) \"*Flycheck errors*\") 8)))

  (defun winum-assign-0-to-neotree ()
    (when (string-match-p (buffer-name) \".*\\*NeoTree\\*.*\") 10))

  (add-to-list
    'winum-assign-functions #'winum-assign-9-to-calculator-8-to-flycheck-errors)
  (add-to-list
    'winum-assign-functions #'winum-assign-0-to-neotree)"
  :group 'winum
  :type  'list)


(defcustom winum-auto-setup-mode-line t
  "When nil, `winum-mode' will not display window numbers in the mode-line.
You might want this to be nil if you use a package that already manages window
numbers in the mode-line."

  "Format string defining how the window number looks like in the mode-line.
This string is passed to the `format' function along with the
